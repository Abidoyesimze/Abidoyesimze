👋 Hi, I'm Similoluwa Abidoye!

I'm a Smart Contract Developer and Frontend Developer with a passion for building decentralized applications (dApps) that solve real-world problems.
I love working on blockchain-based projects, including land registry systems, voting platforms, crowdfunding applications, and DeFi systems.

💡 What I'm Currently Working On:
GeoTrust: A decentralized land registry platform that uses blockchain and smart contracts to tokenize land ownership,
ensuring transparency, fraud prevention, and seamless property transfers.
This project integrates features like cryptographic signatures, ownership history, and IPFS document storage.
Developing scalable Web3 projects to solve real-life challenges 

🛠️ Technologies I Use:
Blockchain: Solidity, Hardhat, Ethers.js, OpenZeppelin, wagmi
Frontend:  JavaScript, React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS
Smart Contracts: ERC20, ERC721, Merkle Airdrop, Multisig
Web3 Tools: Wagmi, Ethers Adapter, AppKit, IPFS, Alchemy
📚 My Latest Projects:
GeoTrust: A decentralized land registry platform.
Voting System: Built on smart contracts for decentralized voting.
Crowdfunding Platform: Blockchain-based system for secure funding.
PharmaX: A smart contract-based system for pharmaceutical transactions, integrating features like KYC, product addition, and wallet connection.
🌱 I'm Currently Learning:
Further enhancing decentralized identity management for Web3 applications.
Exploring real-world blockchain solutions in land ownership, voting, and supply chain transparency.
